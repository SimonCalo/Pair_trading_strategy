# Pair_trading_strategy
A project outlining a simple pair-trading strategy with data visualisation and statistical analysis of a pair of correlated stocks.

The two stocks used are dummy ones, only used for the purpose of this repository.
The analysis carried out here can be clearly extended to any pair of stocks, and through the tools included in this repository one can determine whether the two stocks are correlated, cointegrated, and if a simple pair strategy with them could be profitable.
